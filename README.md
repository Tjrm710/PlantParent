# PlantParent
An estimated 98% of plastic plant pots end up in landfills, and plastic soil bags add to our current plastic pollution problems. 
I've created a simple python script that texts me (for free over a MMS gateway) weather alerts on weather that may kill my specific types of plants. I am designing this into an application
so that I may begin to fight waste at the individual level, starting with plant owners. I am full stack developing PlantParent for mobile applications that utilizes a SQL database.
